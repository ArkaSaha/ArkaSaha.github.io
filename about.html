<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p>In a nutshell, I am an avid learner getting closer to becoming a computer scientist by the day. <b>I am a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor at the <a href="https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/" class="down">University of Tsukuba</a> in Japan, currently serving as a Visiting Researcher at <a href="https://www.liglab.fr" class="down">Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble</a> in France.</b> Earlier, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at <a href="https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr" class="down">Universit√© Grenoble Alpes</a> in France, after being a Research Fellow at <a href="https://www.cnrsatcreate.cnrs.fr" class="down">CNRS@CREATE</a> in Singapore. Prior to this, I finished my PhD in Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg" class="down" target="_blank">NTU Singapore</a> in 2022. Before that, I graduated from <a href="https://www.iitd.ac.in" class="down" target="_blank">IIT Delhi</a> in 2018, where I was conferred the degree of BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a Departmental Specialization in Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. I hail from the steel city of Durgapur, West Bengal, India, where I completed my schooling in 2014.</p>
<h2> My Interests </h2>
<h3> Research: </h3>
<p>I am currently working on applying algorithms for graph data to solve problems in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) by interpreting neural networks as graphs. Earlier, during and just after my PhD, my research focused on efficient and effective algorithms for large-scale graph data management and mining. However, I am open to research in other areas of big graph data as well.</p>
<h3> Hobbies: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Singing and Listening to Music (mainly Indian) </li>
<li> Following Football (mainly European) </li>
</ul> <br> <br> <br>
